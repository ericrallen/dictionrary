# dictionrary v0.0.1

**Note**: This is not an elegant solution, but it works well for simple dictionary attacks against a RAR file.

A basic shell script for checking a password-protected RAR file against a word list.

I was working through a mission on the [Enigma Group](http://www.enigmagroup.org/) site and ended up with a password protected RAR that I needed to get some information from.

I couldn't get rarcrack to work with the particular file I was using so I wrote a basic script to take care of it.

It could definitely be upgraded in numerous ways.
